	<h1> I will wait</h1>
	<p>Our distance is like Milky Way and Andromeda,
  	<br>Even traveling at the speed of light, it will take a million years to reach
  	<br>It can’t be seen by the naked eye but I feel you are at my side
  	<br>Daydreaming that we hold each other hand,
  	<br>And do nothing all day long.
	</p>
	<p>
	Distance is the biggest burden in life,
	<br>It can cost time and effort,
	<br>Multiplied by the temptation in the surroundings,
	<br>But despite of that, we gonna conquer them all,
	<br>Through faith, loyalty and patient, we’re unstoppable.
	</p>
	<p>
	I might be lost in dark and loneliest road,
	<br>Pretending to be normal but mentally challenged,
	<br>Seeking the light in the darkest doom,
	<br>Even we barely see each other but remember this,
	<br>I will wait!
	</p>
